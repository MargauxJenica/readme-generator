# readme-generator

## Description

The objective of this project is s to build a command-line application that streamlines the process of generating a high-quality README.md file, enhancing the overall documentation and potential collaboration on your open-source project.To achieve this, you'll be utilizing the Inquirer package to prompt the user for input. The application should be invoked with the command node index.js, and it should generate a comprehensive README file based on the provided user input.

    1. Users are able to search for a city and the web application will display the current and future forecasts. This search is then saved in the user's search history.
    2. The forecasts will display the city's name, date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon related to predicted weather. 
    3. Users can click into their search history and be presented with current and future data for that city.  

 The README file is a crucial component of any GitHub repository, providing essential information about the project, such as its purpose, usage instructions, installation process, reporting issues, making contributions, and more.
